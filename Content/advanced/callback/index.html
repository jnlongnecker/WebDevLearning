        Some of you may be curious why the popup is placed here. Why not place it at the top or the bottom?
        This has to do with tab order. Remember that thing? As a best practice, we shouldn't manipulate it. Well, if 
        this was placed at the top, the button would be first in the tab order. If it was at the bottom, if I wanted
        to place any other tabbable elements after the form, those would be next in the tab order. Placing it here
        puts it in the correct tab order flow for users.

        Spinner holder is here. While typically it is not a good idea to have your JS populate your HTML, this spinner
        requires great precision in timing and the angles to be placed at. It would be far more cumbersome to write this
        in strict HTML and CSS, so we use JavaScript here to fit its strengths.

    <!-- Static text for page explanation -->
    <p class="explanation">
        This example uses several callback functions together in order to function:
    </p>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li>
                One callback function starts the timer after a delay for the animation.
            </li>
            <li>
                One callback function stops the timer after the time specified.
            </li>
            <li>
                One callback function decrements the timer.
            </li>
            <li>
                One callback function ends the animation after the time specified.
            </li>
            <li>
                One callback function enables the button after the animation completes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="explanation">
        Additionally, there is exception handling for invalid inputs. Try a bad number and see what happens.
